#SWOT Analysis

##Strengths
* Overall premise is inspiring and uplifting
* Fun interactive way to encourage kindness with friends
* A way to track just how far doing a good deed can impact the lives of others

##Weaknesses
* Potentially could become more about the person committing the good deed instead of the deed itself
* Members are required to have a social media account/email and/or create a login in order to use
* The success relies solely on whether or not people respond to the challenges people send.


##Opportunities
* All competitor apps have extremely poor functionality, either they crash all of the time or features don't work all together
* Through using social media as it's main platform and requiring the potential user to join in order to respond to a 
friend's challenge, there is an increased chance of members joining/accounts being made.
* Could be used as an educational tool in schools to promote kindness 

##Threats
* There are a lot of apps already available based on similar concept:

###List of Top Competitors
1. _**Nobly**_ - social media based app involving posting/sharing good deeds and creating/joining chains in order to track
the affect of good deeds.
   * Main news feed shares both most recent posts, as well as most popular which consists of posts the creator felt
   were best.
   * Directly connect with friends: send chains, get updates, etc.
   * Blog feature causes app to crash.
   * Poor heirarchy, size of photos in news feed makes it hard to follow.
2. **_Ripil_** - Much like Nobly, but more group focused and no news feed.
   * Receive points for completion
   * Can view actions from all over th world
   * Provides suggestions of acts and you receive points for finishing
   * Donates to a designated cause for every deed completed
3. _**More Good Deeds (mgd)**_ - very similar to Nobly even in news feed layout
4. _**The Great Kindess Challenge**_ - provides lists of already created good deeds to be performed that users can
complete and keep track of.
